# SoulDebug
This is a debug tool that currently supports C/C++. It can perform basic memory, breakpoint and single-step debugging functions for C/C++ programs. Additionally, it provides script debugging, such as inserting a complex piece of C/C++ code to influence the intermediate process results of the debugged program without modifying its source code.
